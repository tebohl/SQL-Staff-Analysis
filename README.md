# sql-challenge

In this assignment, I performed data modeling, engineering, and analysis using 
files containing information about employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. 
I designed tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and 
answered questions about the data.
